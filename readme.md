This is basically an experiment to map the UK roads traffic flows and to make a data vis application out of it

all the files under es6_js folder is complied to files in the js folder by babel (Grunt task)

how it works (a lot in my head at the moment...) :
- thickness of the roads correspond to the annual traffic volume

TODO:

- other linked charts
- map to change with year
- explanation text

Data sources:

- OS open roads data simplified (with QGIS, in https://github.com/wwymak/os-openroads-geodata)
- uk traffic count data parsed (from http://www.dft.gov.uk/traffic-counts/download.php)
